# OAuth API

To use the OAuth API, a valid OAuth access token must be presented for each request.
If password authentication is enabled for a user account, the OAuth API can also be accessed via HTTP basic authentication.

The OAuth API only grants access to a limited set of functionality. No functionality requiring admin permissions is accessible
via this API, use the [Admin API](admin_api.md) with an API key instead.

## OAuth endpoints

* `/oauth/v2/token`: Token endpoint, grants a new access token when presented a refresh token.
* `/oauth/v2/auth`: Authorization endpoint, redirect the user to here with the proper query parameters to allow them to authorize your application.

## OAuth applications

A new OAuth application can be added at `/admin/oauth/clients` by a super-admin.
An application can be set to pre-approved, which means the user will not be shown an authorization page the first time
he connects to the application.
The scopes this pre-approval is valid for can be limited by pre-approved scopes. If more scopes are requested, the
authorization page is displayed.

## Serialization formats

All data is available in json and xml.
The html format is not stable, and not meant for machine usage (but it is available anyways).
When no `Accept` header or file extension is provided, the json format is used.

The json format is used when `Accept: application/json` is sent as a request header, or when the URL ends in `.json`.
This format is the recommended format for all usages of the API.

The xml format is used when `Accept: text/xml` is sent as a request header, or when the URL ends in `.xml`.
This format is not recommended, but is available for the benefit of people who find json to mainstream.

### `GET /api/properties/{namespace}`

Lists all properties in a namespace.
This listing only contains the properties that have been set on the user previously.

Requires scope `property:read`

the contents of the property.

### `GET /api/properties/{namespace}/{name}`

### `PUT /api/properties/{namespace}/{name}`

Updates the content of a property. If the property does not exist, it is created.

Requires scope `property:write`
Requires the namespace to be globally writeable, or the application to have write permissions for the namespace.

The body of the request is stored as-is and will be returned verbatim on a corresponding GET request.
The `Content-Type` header used for this request is also stored and returned when the property is fetched.

### `DELETE /api/properties/{namespace}/{name}`
